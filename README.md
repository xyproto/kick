# kick

A Go module and utility for generating kick drum audio samples.

Includes one little program for generating kick drum samples based on settings and values and one little program for mutating sounds and generating samples.

This is a bit experimental, and a work in progress!

# Kick Drum Samples

See the `samples` folder for a few examples of what the generated kick drum sounds can sound like.
